## Environment Setup

Before running the project, install the Tauri 2 prerequisites: Node.js, pnpm, Rust, and the required system dependencies for your operating system. 

On macOS, the development commands are the same as below after installing the Tauri prerequisites. If you install a built app manually, it is not signed, so you may need to remove the quarantine flag after moving it to Applications:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/biometrics-studio.app
```

Use the actual app path if it is different for you.

Clone the repository and run the development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BiometricsUBB/Forensic-Biometrics-Studio.git
cd Forensic-Biometrics-Studio
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Coding Style

- Frontend code is written in TypeScript with `strict` mode enabled.
- We follow the ESLint configuration from the repository, including `airbnb`,
  `@typescript-eslint`, `jsx-a11y`, `sonarjs`, `security`, `react-hooks`, and
  `prettier`.
- Formatting is handled by Prettier: 4-space indentation, 80-character line
  width, semicolons, double quotes, and no tabs.
- Do not use `any`; `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is treated as an error.
- Do not leave unused variables or parameters; TypeScript and ESLint treat them
  as errors.
- Imports from `src` should use the `@/` alias.
- React components and UI files usually use `kebab-case.tsx`, domain classes
  use `PascalCase.ts`, and hooks use `useName.tsx`.
- Before committing, it is recommended to run:

```bash
pnpm tsc:check
pnpm eslint:check
pnpm prettier:write
pnpm test:unit
```
